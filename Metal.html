                <p class="para" id="p1">
                    What is scandium used for?
                    Scandium is mainly used for research purposes. It has, however, great potential because it has
                    almost as low a density as aluminium and a much higher melting point. <br>
                    Scandium allows for aircrafts to have a thinner fuselage. Eliminating this weight maximizes fuel
                    efficiency. Airframes made from aluminium-scandium alloys are more resistant to corrosion and
                    ensure
                    thermal stability when exposed to higher temperatures.
                    <br> An aluminium-scandium
                    alloy
                    has been used for aerospace components, additive in Mercury-vapor lamps.

                        A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum family, iridium is the
                        second-densest element. <br>
                        Iridium's primary use is a hardening agent for platinum</p>

                        Yttrium is often used as an additive in alloys. It increases the strength of aluminium and
                        magnesium alloys. It is also used in the making of microwave filters for radar and has been
                        used
                        as a catalyst in ethene polymerisation. <br> Yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG) is used in
                        lasers

                        compounds
                        containing lanthanum are used extensively in carbon lighting applications, such as studio
                        lighting and cinema projection. <br>
                        Lanthanum(III) oxide is used in making special optical glasses, as it improves the optical
                        properties and alkali resistance of the glass. Lanthanum salts are used in catalysts for
                        petroleum refining.
                        <br>
                        A lanthanum-nickel alloy is used to store hydrogen gas for use in hydrogen-powered vehicles.

                        tanning
                        booths, since it transmits the tanning UV rays but not the heating infrared rays.
